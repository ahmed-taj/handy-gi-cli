## Submitting a Pull Request

For the time being, I don't have any plans or a roadmap for what features we can possibly add in future for this project, as it's just a simple CLI wrapper around [handy-gi] package. Consider opening an [issue] to discuss your awesome feature before writing its code.

Also, I would really appreciate PRs that fix missing doc/tests and typos :)
